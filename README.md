In this book, [Michael Hausenblas](https://twitter.com/mhausenblas) and [Stefan Schimanski](https://twitter.com/the_sttts)  teach you how to develop cloud native apps with the Kubernetes API. We cover everything from custom resources to `client-go` to operators to custom API servers and cloud native programming languages. A solid understanding of Kubernetes and familiarity with the Go programming language are required to benefit from this book.
